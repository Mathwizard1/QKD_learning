# Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) Protocol
This project implements a Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) Protocol using quantum computing concepts. QKD enables two parties, typically named Alice and Bob, to securely share a cryptographic key that can be used for symmetric encryption. The security of the key exchange is guaranteed by the laws of quantum mechanics, specifically through the no-cloning theorem, which prevents an eavesdropper (Eve) from copying the quantum states without detection.

# Current Features
Implementation of the B92 protocol.
Simulation of quantum circuits using Qiskit_Aer and classical post-processing to generate a shared secret key.
Visualization of quantum states and measurements.
Error detection mechanism to ensure eavesdropping is detected.
