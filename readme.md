# Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) — Basic

A small project demonstrating Quantum Key Distribution concepts and simulations using Qiskit. It includes examples of QKD protocols and classical post-processing to produce shared secret keys that can be used with a Vernam cipher (one‑time pad).

## QKD protocols
- BB84
- B92
- E91

## Current Features
- Entanglement examples and circuit construction for E91-style experiments
- Classical post-processing: basis reconciliation and key sifting
- Visualization of states and measurement histograms
- Simple Vernam cipher (one‑time pad) encryption/decryption using generated keys

## Quick start
1. Create and activate a Python virtual environment.
2. Install dependencies from requirements.txt.
3. Run the notebook(s) to simulate circuits and generate keys.
